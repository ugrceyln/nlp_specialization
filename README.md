### Course 1: Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces

##### What we we learned ? 

* Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then naïve Bayes,
* Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and
* Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality-sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.  

* Use logistic regression, naïve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies & translate words.

##### Obtained Skills
- Machine Translation
- Word Embeddings
- Locality-Sensitive Hashing
- Sentiment Analysis
- Vector Space Models
